# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
## About Me

I am Sierra Negron, a student Game Developer pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Game Development at Full Sail University.

I enjoy learning various different APIs used for graphics rendering, as well as creating simple projects in Unreal Engine 4 and Unity. I first started programming in November 2020, and have since learned to code in C# and C++, with a little bit of experience working with Java, Python, CMake, and Premake.

Outside of programming, I enjoy playing video games, learning different musical instruments, drawing, writing stories, and spending time outdoors. My passion for art and storytelling, combined with my love for video games is what sparked my desire to become a game developer. Whether it's on my own free time or a full-time project, I plan on creating my own game(s) in the future!
